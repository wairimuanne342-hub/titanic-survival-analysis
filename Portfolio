# Titanic Survival Analysis using R

## Project Overview
This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster to identify key factors associated with survival. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a binary classification model, the project examines how demographic and socio-economic variables influenced survival outcomes.

The objective of this project is to:
1. Explore patterns and relationships within the data using visualizations.
2. Build and evaluate a predictive model that estimates passenger survival with reasonable accuracy.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger-level information, including:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Passenger class  
- Fare  
- Survival outcome (Yes / No)

Missing values were handled during preprocessing to ensure reliable and consistent analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Age Distribution by Survival
The age distribution analysis shows that most passengers were young adults between 20 and 40 years old. Survival occurred across nearly all age groups; however, children and younger passengers showed relatively higher survival counts compared to older age groups.

Passengers above the age of 50 had noticeably fewer survivors, suggesting that survival probability generally declined with age. Despite these trends, there is substantial overlap between survivors and non-survivors, indicating that age alone is not sufficient to explain survival outcomes.

**Insight:**  
Age contributes to survival differences but is not a strong standalone predictor.

### Survival Proportion by Sex
A strong survival disparity is observed when survival is grouped by sex. Approximately three-quarters of female passengers survived, while the majority of male passengers did not.

This pattern reflects the historical evacuation practice of prioritizing women and children. Sex emerges as one of the strongest predictors of survival in the dataset.

**Insight:**  
Female passengers were significantly more likely to survive than male passengers.

## Modeling Approach
A binary classification model was developed to predict survival outcomes. Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics to ensure balanced and reliable predictions rather than relying solely on accuracy.

---

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 80.3%  
- **95% Confidence Interval:** (72.8%, 86.5%)  
- **No Information Rate:** 59.2%  
- **P-Value (Accuracy > NIR):** < 0.001  
- **Kappa:** 0.59  

### Class-Specific Performance
- **Sensitivity:** 84.5%  
- **Specificity:** 74.1%  
- **Balanced Accuracy:** 79.3%  

The model performs significantly better than a baseline classifier and maintains a good balance between identifying survivors and non-survivors. The Kappa score indicates moderate to strong agreement beyond chance, and McNemar’s test suggests no systematic classification bias.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that survival on the Titanic was strongly influenced by demographic factors, particularly sex, while age played a secondary role. The predictive model achieved reliable performance and provides interpretable results suitable for decision-support rather than naive prediction.

The project highlights the importance of combining exploratory analysis with model evaluation to derive meaningful insights from real-world data.
